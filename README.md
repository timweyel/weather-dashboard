[Deployed Application](https://timweyel.github.io/weather-dashboard/)

## Requirements

For this project, we need to use the OpenWeatherMap api to take a user entered city and return the current weather results for that city as well as the 5-day forecast. The city that was searched for needs to be saved to local storage and have a button created for that city so that the user can easily search for a past city.

### Additional Requirements

Weather results should include:
  - city name
  - the date
  - an icon representation of weather conditions
  - the temperature
  - the humidity
  - the wind speed
  - the UV index

The UV index should be shaded with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

Future weather conditions for that city should:
  - displays the date
  - an icon representation of weather conditions
  - the temperature
  - the humidity

### User Story
